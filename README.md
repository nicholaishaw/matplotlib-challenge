# Cancer Drug Analysis Using Pandas and Matplotlib

## Background

The effectiveness of ten cancer-treating drugs were assessed with the following data. Two hundred and forty-eight mice were randomly assigned to a drug intervention of either Ramicane, Capomulin, Infubinol, Ceftamin, Stelasyn, Zoniferol, Ketapril, Propriva, Naftisol, or a placebo. Each mouse had a cancerous tumor and its size was measuered at ten different time points. With the use of the following code, a boxplot of the drugs Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin was created to evaluate their effectiveness. The boxplot demonstrated that both Capomulin and Infubinol were associated with a higher tumor volume than the other drugs. In addition, a linear regression analysis was conducted on mouse weight and tumor volume for mice assigned to the Capomulin treatment regimen. The regression revealed a significant positive association between tumor volume and mouse weight (r=0.841, p=1.322e-07).
